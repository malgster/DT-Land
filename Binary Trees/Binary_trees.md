## Introduction 

A binary tree is a  type of **graph** : a hierarchical data structure with a set of connected nodes, with each node bifurcating *two children nodes **at most**,* referred to as *left child* and *right child*

A binary tree is hierarchical, it always *has one root*, where the bifurcation begins.
