# Queues 

## Introduction 

A queue is a linear data structure, similar to Stacks, but unlike them a queue is open at it's ends. It follows the **FIFO (First In First Out)** methodology, which means that *the first element to enter the queue is the one that will be removed first.* 

the first element to enter the queue is called the **head** and the last element to enter is called the **head**.

## In memory

Our implementation of queues in memory are structured exactly like **Linked lists** multiple elements consisting of a *value* and *pointer* that points to the next element.
