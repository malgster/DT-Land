***Docendo discimus*** : By teaching, we learn.

This repository exists because i wanted to learn how data structures worked, so the best way i found is to implement them in C ~~the god tier language~~ because there are no native implementation of them (except for arrays that we improved), and it's the perfect language to write them from scratch.

Only a familiarity with programming and C syntax is required, i made the code as relatively clear and commented ~~way to much~~  a lot of it.

// there will be readme by data struct ?
